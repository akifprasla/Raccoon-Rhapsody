# Raccoon-Rhapsody
is multi-player online game. 
The company wants to streamline maintaining the RR-DB database that backs the game.  
One task that game administrators have to do is to create new quests on a regular basis for the players. 
This involves making a new entry into the Quest table for the new quest for a future day with a given theme and region. 
And then assigning loot — adding to the Loot table — for the new quest.  
You have been asked to automate this task with an application program, let us call it CreateQuest. 
You are to make this in Java using JDBC; so, CreateQuest.java. 
The app should connect with PostgreSQL database server at db  with the RR-DB database to make the necessary updates on request.


The other two files are included to add, populate and drop the data into database.
